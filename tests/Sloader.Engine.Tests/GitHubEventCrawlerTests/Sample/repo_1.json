I wrote some code that tries to connect and return a promise with the connection on success and an empty promise on fail and tries all different protocols until it has a connection. I think I wrote it ok, but an example would be great because I think lots of people want a fallback protocol. \r\n\r\nThere are still some issues I experience, I will look into them and maybe the are because its just because its just production ready but maybe you can address these issues immediately.\r\n\r\n- Internet explorer 11 works fine on websockets. On long polling it connects fine, but as soon as it get the first data from the hub, it keeps sending infinit connecting requests.\r\n-  On azure, while I turned on websockets it keeps connecting using long polling. \r\n"

But, in the case, a possible solution could be to explicitly invoke & await each subscriber, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (receivedHandler != null)\r\n{\r\n    foreach (var d in receivedHandler.GetInvocationList().OfType<Func<byte[], Task>>())\r\n    {\r\n        await d(buffer);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on [this answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41765701)."

I ran the build.cmd /t:Restore command, and it gave me the following output: \r\n\r\n[Output](https://gist.github.com/gabor182/d3279703f442cd23a5ceb2bbac46cbbf)\r\n\r\nWhere can these missing packages be found? If some additional package feeder is needed, then it would be wise to put its url into the readme file (or the build script could automatically update the package source list if a nuget.exe location is given in a command arg)\r\nIs there any way to have a .NET Core 2.0 compatible version of SignalR?"

But, in the case, a possible solution could be to explicitly invoke & await each subscriber, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (receivedHandler != null)\r\n{\r\n    foreach (var d in receivedHandler.GetInvocationList().OfType<Func<byte[], Task>>())\r\n    {\r\n        await d(buffer);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on [this answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41765701)."

But, in the case, a possible solution could be to explicitly invoke & await each subscriber, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (receivedHandler != null)\r\n{\r\n    foreach (var d in receivedHandler.GetInvocationList().OfType<Func<byte[], Task>>())\r\n    {\r\n        await d(buffer);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on [this answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41765701)."
